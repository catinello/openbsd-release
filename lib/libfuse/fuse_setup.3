.Sh NAME
.Nm fuse_setup
.Nd FUSE helper function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libfuse
.In fuse.h
.Ft struct fuse *
.Fn fuse_setup "int argc" "char **argv" \
    "const struct fuse_operations *ops" "size_t size" "char **mp" \
    "int *mt" "void *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn fuse_setup
is a helper function that mounts a FUSE file system, creates a new FUSE
session and installs signal handlers that will try to unmount the file
system on
.Dv SIGINT ,
.Dv SIGTERM ,
or
.Dv SIGHUP .
.Pp
.Fn fuse_setup
parses the arguments specified by
.Fa argv ,
and if neither the
.Fl f ,
.Fl d ,
or
.Fl odebug
options were specified, detaches from the controlling terminal
and runs in the background.
On success,
.Fa mt
is set to 1 if the file system operations will be invoked in
parallel (multi-threaded) or to 0 if file system operations are serialized.
File systems that do not support multi-threaded operation must include the
.Fl s
argument in
.Fa argv .
.Ox
does not currently support multi-threaded operation.
.Pp
The file system will be mounted on
.Fa mp ,
which is the directory specified by the first
argument that does not match one of the options recognised by
.Xr fuse_parse_cmdline 3 .
.Pp
.Fa fuse_operations
is a struct of size
.Fa size
that contains pointers to FUSE file system operations.
